    description: `InSight, short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, 
    Geodesy and Heat Transport, is a Mars lander designed to give the Red Planet its 
    first thorough checkup since it formed 4.5 billion years ago.`,
    launch: `May 5, 2018, Vandenberg Air Force Base, California (USA)`,
    landed: `November 26, 2018`,
    missionCompleted: `The mission ended on December 21, 2022 after mission controllers 
    determined the solar-powered spacecraft ran out of energy.`,
    explanation: `In January 2021, InSights Mole ended its journey on Mars. Starting 
    on Feb. 28, 2019, the probe attempted to burrow into the Martian surface to take the 
    planets internal temperature and provide details about the interior heat engine that 
    drives Mars evolution and geology. But the soils unexpected tendency to clump deprived 
    the spike-like mole of the friction needed to hammer itself to a sufficient depth.
    After getting the top of the mole about 2 or 3 centimeters under the surface, the team 
    tried one last time to use a scoop on InSights robotic arm to scrape soil onto the probe
     and tamp it down to provide added friction. After the probe conducted 500 additional 
     hammer strokes on Jan. 9, 2021, with no progress, the team called an end to their efforts.`,
     quickFacts: {
        fact1: `Lander brought the first seismometer to Mars.`,
        fact2: `It recorded "sounds" of Martian winds on the Red Planet for the first time.`,
        fact3: `It was provided with specific instruments like Robot Arm, Two Color Cameras, IR Radiometer,Laser Retroreflector`,
        fact4: `Spacecraft Mass was	794 pounds (360 kilograms)`,
        fact5: `The lander monitored marsquakes, providing details on Mars interior, formation, and activity such as meteor impacts. `,
        fact6: `InSight was also providing daily weather reports from Mars. This public tool includes stats on temperature, wind, and air
         pressure recorded at InSight's landing site.`,
