    description: `This image of a bizarre-looking formation in a region known as Noctis Labyrinthus, which translates to Labyrinth of the night. The wavy areas around this mesa are sand dunes.
    Heavily eroded, with clusters of boulders and sand dunes on its surface, this layered mesa is probably comprised of sedimentary deposits that are being exhumed as it erodes. NASA says.`,
