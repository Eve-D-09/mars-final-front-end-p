     In this bone-chilling weather, the Red Planet also hosts a second kind of ice made from carbon dioxide, known as dry ice.
    Unlike our water frost at home, Mars carbon dioxide frost doesn't melt. Instead, when temperatures warm, it converts directly 
    from a solid to a gas in a shift called sublimation. In the process, fantastic formations are created on the ground, ranging 
    from spider-like intertwining lines to scattered polka dots.`,

    water ice and dust. They go hundreds of meters deep into the planet. Above them is a visible layer of dry ice. It is formed as a
     result of seasonal freezing of carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere.
    The average thickness of the dry ice layer is on average small and does not exceed a meter. `,
