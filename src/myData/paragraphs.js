    title: `When the exploration started`,
    content: `Mars has been explored remotely by spacecraft. 
    Probes sent from Earth, beginning in 1997, have yielded a large increase
     in knowledge about the Martian system, focused primarily on understanding its geology and
     habitability potential. Interplanetary journeys are complicated and the exploration of Mars has experienced a 
     high failure rate, especially the early attempts. Roughly 60% of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before 
     completing their missions. However Some missions have met an unexpected success, such as the twins Mars Exploration Rovers,
    Spirit and Opportunity which operated for years beyond their specification.

    Various sample return missions are being planned  that will pick up the samples
    currently being collected by the Perseverance rover.`,
