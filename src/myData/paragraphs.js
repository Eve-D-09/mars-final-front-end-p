    title: `When the exploration started`,
    content: `Mars has been explored remotely by spacecraft. 
    Probes sent from Earth, beginning in 1997, have yielded a large increase
     in knowledge about the Martian system, focused primarily on understanding its geology and
     habitability potential. Interplanetary journeys are complicated and the exploration of Mars has experienced a 
     high failure rate, especially the early attempts. Roughly 60% of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before 
     completing their missions. However Some missions have met an unexpected success, such as the twins Mars Exploration Rovers,
    Spirit and Opportunity which operated for years beyond their specification.

    both operated by the American space agency NASA, as well as the Zhurong rover, part of the 
     mission by the China National Space Administration (CNSA). European Space agency have sent Mars Express Orbiter on 2003. 
     As of february 2021, there have been 18 spacecraft missions operating in Mars' orbit, 8 of which are currently active.
     In 2022, contact was lost to India's Mars Orbiter Mission.  `,

    title: `Who is exploring now`,
    content: `There are 7 orbiters surveying the planet. Maven, Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, 
    including Ingenuity helicopter, which is scouting sites for Perseverance to study.
     Both rovers are operating in different parts of Mars and have slighly 
    different missions. Only Perseverance rover is collecting samples. With planned launch dates for the Earth Return Orbiter 
    and Sample Retrieval Lander in fall 2027 and 
    summer 2028, respectively, the samples are expected to arrive on Earth in 2033. `,
