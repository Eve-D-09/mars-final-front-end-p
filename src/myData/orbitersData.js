        description: `The goal is to use this data to determine how the loss of volatiles from the Martian 
        atmosphere has affected the Martian climate over time, and thus contribute to a better understanding 
        of terrestrial climatology.`,
        instruments: ``,
        facts: {
            fact1: `Though MAVEN was designed to last two years, the spacecraft is operating normally 
            and has enough fuel to operate through 2030.`,

            relay data between Earth and rovers or landers on the surface of Mars.`,
            fact3: `MAVEN made a series of close flybys of Phobos, Mars largest moon, coming within 310 
            miles (500 kilometers) of its surface, and collecting spectral images using the imaging ultraviolet 
            spectrometer (IUVS).`,
            fact4: ` Based on collected data, scientists detected two unanticipated phenomena in the Martian atmosphere, 
            one involving a high-altitude dust cloud at about 93 to 190 miles (150 to 300 kilometers) in altitude. 
            The other discovery was a bright ultraviolet auroral glow in the northern hemisphere. `,

        key information on its surface and the radiation hazards future explorers might face. The goal

         or present water and volcanic activity on Mars.`,

            using 21,000 images from the THEMIS instrument.`,
            fact3: ` Mars Odyssey had found evidence of salt deposits in 200 locations in southern Mars. 
            These chloride minerals were left behind in places where water was once abundant.`,

        dimensions: `Orbiter has a height of 6.5 meters (21
            ft) topped by a 3-meter (10-foot) radio antenna dish. Its
            width from the tip of one solar panel to the other is
            about 13.6 meters (45 ft). The solar panels have about 20
            sqm (220 sqt) of solar cells. The spacecraft
            weighed about 2,180 kg (4,800 pounds) at launch.  `,
        description: `Its primary goals are to map the Martian surface with a high-resolution telescopic camera, 
        at least partly to help select sites for future landing missions. The camera, called the high-resolution 
        imaging science experiment camera, or HiRISE, is a 1.6-foot (0.5-meter) diameter reflecting telescope, 
        the largest ever carried on a deep space mission.`,

             than the weekly total of all other active Mars missions.`,
            fact3: `One of the early findings from imagery collected by HiRISE was the presence of liquid carbon dioxide 
            or water on the surface of Mars in its recent past. `,
            fact4: `MRO captured a 12-mile-high (20-kilometer-high) dust devil whirling its way across the Amazonis Planitia 
            region of northern Mars.`,
            fact5: `Scientists got evidence  from MROs imaging spectrometer which
            provided the strongest evidence yet that liquid water still flows intermittently on present-day Mars. 
            Scientists later concluded that water ice makes up half or more of an underground layer in the Utopia 
            Planitia region.`,
