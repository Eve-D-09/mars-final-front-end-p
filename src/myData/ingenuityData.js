    mission: `The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter is a small aircraft carried to the surface 
    of the Red Planet attached to the belly of the Perseverance rover. Ingenuity mission 
    is experimental in nature and completely independent of the rover's science mission.It's 
    main job is a technology demonstration to test the first powered flight on Mars.`,
    launch: `July 30, 2020, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida`,
    landing: `February 18, 2021, Jezero Crater, Mars`,
    techSpecs: {
        mass: `1.8 kilograms ( ~ 4 pounds )`,
        length: `Total length of rotors: ~4 feet (~1.2 meters)`,
        power: `Solar panel charges Lithium-ion batteries, providing enough energy for
         one 90-second flight per Martian day (~350 Watts of average power during flight)`,
         flightRange: `Up to 980 feet (300 meters)`,
         flightAltitude: `Up to 15 feet (5 meters)`,

    },
    quickFacts: {
        fact1: `First test of powered flight on another planet.`,
        fact2: `Previewing areas of Mars of possible interest for the Perseverance rover to explore`,
        fact3: `Completing 91.4 flying minutes, covering 7.3 miles (11.7 km), and reaching altitudes as high as 59.1 ft (18.0 m)`,
        fact4: `The helicopter flies on its own, without human control. It must take off, fly, and land, with minimal commands from Earth sent in advance.`,
        fact5: `Successfully flying in the extremely thin Martian atmosphere`,
        fact6: `One black-and-white 0.5 megapixel downward-facing navigation camera on the bottom of the fuselage and 
        one color 13 megapixel horizon-facing terrain camera on one of the bottom edges of the fuselage.`,
