h1 - Who's exploring Mars? 

p - 

p - Mars has long been the subject of human interest.
telescopic observations found two moons, Phobos and Deimos, polar ice caps and the feature now known as Olympus Mons, 
the Solar System's tallest mountain, which is over 21.9 km (13.6 mi or 72,000 ft) high, as measured by the 
Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). 

p - Mars has been explored remotely by spacecraft. 
Probes sent from Earth, beginning in 1997, have yielded a large increase
 in knowledge about the Martian system, focused primarily on understanding its geology and
 habitability potential. Interplanetary journeys are complicated and the exploration of Mars has experienced a 
 high failure rate, especially the early attempts. Roughly 60% of all spacecraft destined for Mars failed before 
 completing their missions. However Some missions have met an unexpected success, such as the twins Mars Exploration Rovers,
Spirit and Opportunity which operated for years beyond their specification.

p - At the moment, there are 3 operational rovers on the surface of Mars, the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers,
 both operated by the American space agency NASA, as well as the Zhurong rover, part of the 
  mission by the China National Space Administration (CNSA).

p - There are 7 orbiters surveying the planet. Maven, Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are sent by NASA, 
including Ingenuity helicopter, which is scouting sites for Perseverance to study.
Various sample return missions are being planned  that will pick up the samples
currently being collected by the Perseverance rover.
